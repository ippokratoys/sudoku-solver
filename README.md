# sudoku-solver
Is an application in C that solves sudoku(famous game)

How it works:

  INPUT:
    It takes input from a text file(for now with name"input1.sud" 
    that has the 9x9 board: if there is a number you enter 
    the number, else you enter a space.

  OUTPUT:
    It prints every time you press enter a move(it was for debug reasons)
    until the board is full.

  Behind the codes:
    
Small story:

  I started creating this app in my first summer after i joined the university
  just to see if i can do somthing that is not an excercise for university.
