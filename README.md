# sudoku-solver
Is an application in C that solves sudoku(famous game)

How it works:
  
  It takes input from a text file(for now with name"input1.sud" 
  that has the 9x9 board: if there is a number you enter 
  the number, else you enter a space

Small story:

  I started creating this app in my first summer after i joined the university
  just to see if i can do somthing that is not an excercise for university.
